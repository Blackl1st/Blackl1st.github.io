Your computer name is first and foremost an identifier. If you did not have a name, people unfamiliar with you would have a hard time figuring out who you are. In the same way if someone doesn't know your computer name it becomes more difficult to identify your computer when on a network. The name of your computer on many networks is used as an identifier to access your computer for things such as remote help or to target your computer for powershell commands. 

These instructions are the easiest way to find your computer name if your System Administrator has given you access to your "Computer" properties.

<h3><strong>Step Four</strong></h3>

In the resulting window is a field &quot;Computer Name:&quot;. There is your computer name!

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

There are other ways to find your computer name in Windows 7, but this way is by far the easiest. If you can not access the properties menu when right-clicking "Computer" then you should contact your Help Desk or system administrator for further instructions. This process is similar on both Windows 8,8.1 and 10. I will release instructions on those in particular in a later tutorial.
